# Cryptography
## Encryption, decryption, and cracking
## Encrypting a message
### Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:
- [x]   SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE
### Here's what that might look like encrypted:
- [x] YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK

### - That looks an awfully lot like gobbledygook at first, but this encrypted message is actually very related to the original text.
### -  The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount. 

# Decrypting a message
### According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. 
### As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.

# Frequency analysis
## Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language. 

### We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that.
# Known plaintext
## Another term for the original unencrypted message is plaintext. If the enemy already knew some part of the plaintext.
## it will be easier for them to crack the rest of the encrypted version.
### For example, messages tend to start with similar beginnings. In WWII, encrypted German messages always started with a weather forecast, which ultimately made them easier for British mathematician Alan Turing to crack.
