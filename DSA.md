## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received
- [x]  Whiteboard-style interviews are ubiquitous in the tech industry.
- [x]  For those who not had the pleasure, whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview.
- [x]  This kind of environment can feel like a pressure cooker and cause even the most competent engineer to fall apar
###  restate the problem to you to make sure I understand what you’re looking for. 
### The sole parameter for my function will be an integer. 
### The sole output of my function will be an incrementing array, starting from the number 1 and ending at the input number.
### We’re All Human
- [x] remember that we’re all human.
- [x]  Your interviewer has been in your position and understands the stress of a technical interview.
- [x]  Your interviewer has probably seen quite a few candidates sweating it out, but possibly very few open who openly discuss problems in a conversational manner.
### Again, you don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. 
- [x]  You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. 
- [x]  Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.
## 7 tips to ace a programming interview
- [x] Take a few minutes.
- Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews.
- [x] Write down the steps of the solution.
- Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, 
- don’t start writing code down. 
- Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way.
- You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.
- [x] Write pseudocode first.
- Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode.
- [x] Don’t sweat the small stuff.
- Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. 
- [x] Sit down. Be humble.
- A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. 
- It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. 
- [x] Come prepared.
- When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat). 
- If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. 
- It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards.
-  In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. - And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.
