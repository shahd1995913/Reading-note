# Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
## What is a ‘call’?
### The understanding of the call stack is vital to Asynchronous programming
### When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. 


## What does LIFO mean?
### At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).



## What causes a Stack Overflow?
### A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

# JavaScript error messages

## What is a ‘refrence error’?
### This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
## What is a ‘syntax error’?
### occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
## What is a ‘range error’?
### Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

## What is a breakpoint?
### The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.
### You can also add conditional breakpoints by right-clicking a previous set breakpoint, which will make your program stop at that point only if a condition is met, this is awesome for when you want to debug huge cycles for specific values. In this example the breakpoint will point stop when the index reaches 40.
## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
###  can run the debugger by pressing F5 or pressing the green play button.
###  you can see the “history” before reaching that breakpoint. In this case it’s not a long call stack but you can start to see why it is useful, you know the function add was executed
