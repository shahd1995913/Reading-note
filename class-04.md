***There is a rule on the <body> element to set the width of the page to 90% so that there is a small gap between the left and right-hand sides of the browser window and the main content. The three columns are all given a margin of 1% and a width of 31.3%. This adds up to 99.9% of the width of the <body> element, so some browsers might not perfectly align the right-hand side of the third column with other elements on the page.***
