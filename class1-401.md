# Pain and Suffering

##  All germination begins with some stage of pain, as it tends you out of your relaxation zone. The higher the growth, the higher the pain.Although the pain in the setting of growth is a good situation, as long as that pain is what’s important to realize the fullness that you’re intending for.  And even more useful than that, this pain is simply short. It’s what will drive you to advance into the next stage of your life. The pain different from suffering.



## As you work through feeling the pain of growth over the next 10 weeks, consider heavily the story that you attach to it.

## What’s your perspective?
### My point of view through the Python course is that it will enable me to be a smart Python programmer and enable me to do projects in machine learning and deep learning within these weeks.

## Why are you doing this?
### Because I want to reach a degree of high understanding and advanced capabilities in Python programming.

## Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
### At the end of the course I will be a different person in the field of Python because I will have a high degree of understanding in the Python programming language.
## Are you doing this for you?
### Yes of course I am doing this for myself and for my future success.




# Beginners Guide to Big O
## My one Note about Big O 

### 1. The lower the time the algorithm takes, the better its performance. Thus, equation O(1) is considered the best among them, and equation O(n!) is considered the worst of all.
### 2. If I find the code's performance is O(n!) I'll try to find another solution that runs in less time.
### 3.  If the code rating is O(1), this means that it is excellent, runs at a very high speed, and does not need any improvement. It also means that the expected code execution time is constant.
### 4. If the code rating is O(n), then it is good and acceptable.
### 5.  meant by the equation log n is when the value of the loop counter changes multiply or divided.O(log n)
