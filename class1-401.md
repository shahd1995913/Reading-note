# Pain and Suffering

##  All germination begins with some stage of pain, as it tends you out of your relaxation zone. The higher the growth, the higher the pain.Although the pain in the setting of growth is a good situation, as long as that pain is what’s important to realize the fullness that you’re intending for.  And even more useful than that, this pain is simply short. It’s what will drive you to advance into the next stage of your life. The pain different from suffering.



## As you work through feeling the pain of growth over the next 10 weeks, consider heavily the story that you attach to it.

## What’s your perspective?
### My point of view through the Python course is that it will enable me to be a smart Python programmer and enable me to do projects in machine learning and deep learning within these weeks.

## Why are you doing this?
### Because I want to reach a degree of high understanding and advanced capabilities in Python programming.

## Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
### At the end of the course I will be a different person in the field of Python because I will have a high degree of understanding in the Python programming language.
## Are you doing this for you?
### Yes of course I am doing this for myself and for my future success.




# Beginners Guide to Big O

## Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.



## 1. O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
## 2. O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 
## 3. O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set
## 4. O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
