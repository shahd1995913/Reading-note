1. ID Attribute 
- Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page

2. Class Attribute
-  used as a 
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.

3.  Block Elements
- elements always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.


4.  Inline Elements
-  elements always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements.

## This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.
