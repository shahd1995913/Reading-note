# List Comprehensions in Python


# Syntax
##  example:

### my_new_list = [ expression for item in list ]

### - this example that three ingredients are necessary for a python list comprehension to work.

### - First is the expression expression inside the square brackets.
### - Second is the object that the expression will work on. item inside the square brackets.
### - we need an iterable list of objects to build our new list from. 




# Create a List with range()

###  using the range() method to generate a list of numbers.
-   Python iterates(or loops) through each item in that range, and saves a copy of the item in a new list called digits.


# Create a List Using Loops and List Comprehension in Python
### how a list comprehension can be used to write more efficient Python code.  


# Multiplying Parts of a List
###  By taking advantage of list comprehensions, itâ€™s possible to work on only part of a list. 

### For instance, if you only wanted the even numbers in a given range, could find them using a filter.

### Adding a filter to the list comprehension allows for greater flexibility.

###  By using filters, that select certain items from the list, while excluding others.
