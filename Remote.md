# Remote Repositories

## In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.

## Rebasing starts with the common ancestor of two branches: the one you’re on and the one you’re rebasing onto. Then, the diffs resulting from each commit of your current branch are saved to temporary files, and the current branch gets reset to the same commit as that of the branch you are rebasing onto. Last but not least, all changes get applied to the branch you are rebasing onto.

# Example: on Rebasing 
1. checkout test
2. git rebase master


# Rebase vs. Merge

Rebase | Merge
------------ | -------------
The true commit history of a repository should not be altered because it’s a record of occurrences.| Commit histories should be polished and well edited.
