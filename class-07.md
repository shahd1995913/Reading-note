# Tables

## Tables : The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

## Basic Table Sructure
1. <tr> 
- You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag.


2. <td>
- Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing </td> tag.



## Below you can see the code for create a  table in HTML with result.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects

## Sometimes to want several objects to represent similar things.

## Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.
### A function called Hotel will be used as a template for creating new objects that represent hotels. Like all functions, it contains statements. In this case, they add properties or methods to the object.



### The function  Below has three parameters. Each one setsthe value of a property in the object. The methods will be the same for each object created using this function.
