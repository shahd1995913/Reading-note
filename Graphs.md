#  Graph
# What is the  graph ??? 
## is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
##  What is a Undirected Graphs ? 
###  An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. 
### This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
## What is the Directed Graphs (Digraph) ?
### A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
### Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
###  The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes.
##  Common terminology used when working with Graphs:
- [x] Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- [x] Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- [x] Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- [x] Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.


## what is Complete Graphs ?
### -->> A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
## what is Connected Graphs ?
### -->  A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

## what is Disconnected Graphs ?
### -->  A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
