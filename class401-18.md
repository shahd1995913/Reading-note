# Hash Tables
##  What is a Hashtable?
## Terminology:

### Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
### Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
### Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
## Why do we use them?
### 1. Hold unique values
### 2. Dictionary
### 3. Library
##  Structure For Hashing
- [x] Hashing , a hash code turns a key into an integer.  Hash codes should never have randomness to them. 
- [x] It’s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input.
- [x] The same key should always produce the same hash code.
- [x] A hashtable traditionally is created from an array. 
- [x]  this is important for index placement.
- [x]  After you have created your array of the appropriate size, do some sort of logic to turn that “key” into a numeric number value.
