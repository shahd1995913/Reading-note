#  Binary Trees
##   Binary Trees  is a data structure in which every node or vertex has atmost two children.
### In Python, a binary tree can be represented in different ways with different data structures(dictionary or list) and class representation for a node.
## binarytree library helps to directly implement a binary tree.

#  Binary Search Trees
## A Binary Search Tree( BST) for short, is a tree whose nodes store a key that is greater than all of their left child nodes and less than .
### BST is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties.
### Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

### 1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
### 2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
### 3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

#   K-ary Trees.
## -  A full k-ary tree is a tree where each node has either 0 or k children.
### The K-ary tree is a rooted tree, where each node can hold at most k number of children.
### If the value of k is 2, then this is known as binary tree.
###  The binary tree, or ternary trees are some specialized k-ary trees.
###  k-ary trees re generalized.
