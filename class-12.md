# Chart.js
## Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

## A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

1. Setting up
- The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script.

2. Drawing a line chart
- To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. 


3.  Creating a Chart
- It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single canvas node to render the chart.
