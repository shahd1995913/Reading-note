# E-Commerce App
## Ever since e-commerce penetrated the mainstream industry, e-commerce apps (like Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa, etc.) have become omnipresent. These apps are now an integral part of our lives. Thus, if you build a functional e-commerce app, it will show that you have real-world skills to keep up with the latest trends in the industry. Needless to say, you will become an appealing candidate before potential employers.

## Keep in mind that we’re talking about developing a small e-commerce project that is focused more on a particular industry and not a large marketplace like Amazon or eBay. You could choose any industry that interests you, such as electronic devices (mobiles, TVs, laptops, etc.) and develop your e-commerce app around that.

## Your e-commerce app can either deliver products or services. In any case, you must ensure that apart from browsing products or services, customers can enjoy seamless customer service. This is crucial for app success – all-round customer support and good customer experience are two vital elements of any successful app. 

## As far as app features are concerned, keep the layout and interface neat and easy-to-navigate, include the location option for deliveries, incorporate a shopping cart, and a wishlist. Make sure the checkout process incorporates the necessary authentication options (as a guest or registered user).
