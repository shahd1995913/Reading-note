# Conditional Rendering
## 1.  In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need.
## 2.  Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

### Conditional rendering  in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.
###  Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
# Lists and Keys
##  Given the code below, we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values.
## ssign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it.
## Rendering Multiple Components , can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

# Keys
## Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
## Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
# Forms
## HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.
