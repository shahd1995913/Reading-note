# Machine Learning Intro
## Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.
##  For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.
## A task is a specific objective for your algorithms.
## Type of Machine Learning :
## A.  Supervised Learning
### Supervised learning includes tasks for "labeled" data (i.e. you have a target variable).
## B.  Unsupervised Learning
### Unsupervised learning includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).
# 1. Bird's Eye View
## - must develop a reliable, systematic approach to solving problems.
## -  goal is to provide you with an end-to-end blueprint for applied machine learning, while keeping this as actionable and succinct as possible.
# 2. Exploratory Analysis
## "get to know" the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.
# 3. Data Cleaning
##  clean  data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats fancier algorithms.
# 4.Feature Engineering
## Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
## help  algorithms "focus" on what's important by creating new features.
# 5.  Algorithm Selection
##  specific ML process used to train a model.
## Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.
# 6. Model Training
## the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
## aim your models. This step is pretty formulaic once.
