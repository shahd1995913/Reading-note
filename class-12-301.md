# Which HTTP Status Code to Use for Every CRUD App

## In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
## 100’s = 
### These are informational status codes; they usually tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client. 
## 200’s =
### These are the success codes.
## 300’s =
### These are redirection codes. 
## 400’s =
### These are the client error codes. 
## 500’s =
### These are the server error codes.
## What is a status code 202?
###  In case of asynchronous processing of a request (202), this doesn’t mean the request was successfully processed only that it met all validation requirements at the time of sending.


## What is a status code 308?
###  308 Permanent Redirect - This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It’s helpful when we have multiple endpoints for one resource, but don’t want to implement reading from all of them.
## What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
### - 204 No Content - A proper code for updates that don’t return data to the client, for example when just saving a currently edited document.
## What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
### - 414 Request-URI Too Long - This is sometimes the case when the endpoint is right, and the resource exists, but the query makes the URL too long to be interpreted.

## What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
###  -  403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.
