# NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

## NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package.
##  By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem,

### Using NumPy To Read In Files
- It’s possible to use NumPy to directly read csv or other files into arrays

### Indexing NumPy Arrays
- We now know how to create arrays, but unless we can retrieve results from them, there isn’t a lot we can do with NumPy. 

### Slicing NumPy Arrays
- If we instead want to select the first three items from the fourth column, we can do it using a colon (:). 
### Dimensional NumPy Arrays
- with 2-dimensional arrays, such as wines. However, NumPy is a package for working with multidimensional arrays.
### Broadcasting
### Unless the arrays that you’re operating on are the exact same size, it’s not possible to do elementwise operations.
### In cases like this, NumPy performs broadcasting to try to match up elements. Essentially, broadcasting involves a few steps:

1. The last dimension of each array is compared.
2. If the dimension lengths are equal, or one of the dimensions is of length 1, then we keep going.
3. If the dimension lengths aren’t equal, and none of the dimensions have length 1, then there’s an error.

# JupyterLab
##  Enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.
