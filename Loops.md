## loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. 

## The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

##  The pre-increment operator:

* Requires an lvalue operand.
* Increments the actual memory of the operand (not a copy).
* Returns the new value.

## The post-increment operator:
* Requires an lvalue argument.
* Make a copy of the current value.
* Increments the actual memory of the operand (not a copy).
* Returns the previous value (the copy saved).
