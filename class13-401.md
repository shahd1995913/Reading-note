# How to Run Linear Regression in Python
## by using of  Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.
### This data set is available in sklearn Python module, so I will access it using scikitlearn.

# Machine Learning in Python
## 1. Classification :  
### - Identifying which category an object belongs to.
### - Applications: Spam detection, image recognition.
### - Algorithms: SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, and more...
## 2. Regression :
### - Predicting a continuous-valued attribute associated with an object.
###  - Applications: Drug response, Stock prices.
###  - Algorithms: SVR, nearest neighbors, random forest, and more.
## 3. Clustering : 
### - Automatic grouping of similar objects into sets.

### -  Applications: Customer segmentation, Grouping experiment outcomes
### - Algorithms: k-Means, spectral clustering, mean-shift, and more...

## 4. Dimensionality reduction :
### - Reducing the number of random variables to consider.

### - Applications: Visualization, Increased efficiency
### - Algorithms: k-Means, feature selection, non-negative matrix factorization, and more...


## 5.  Model selection :
### - Comparing, validating and choosing parameters and models.

### -  Applications: Improved accuracy via parameter tuning
### -  Algorithms: grid search, cross validation, metrics, and more...

## 6.  Preprocessing :
### - Feature extraction and normalization.

### - Applications: Transforming input data such as text for use with machine learning algorithms.
### - Algorithms: preprocessing, feature extraction, and more...
