# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

### After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that:
1.  understanding 
2.  influencing group norms 
## Were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

## But Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, needed to figure out which norms mattered most. Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group.

## In fact, the data sometimes pointed in opposite directions. The only thing worse than not finding a pattern is finding too many of them. Which norms, Rozovsky and her colleagues wondered, were the ones that successful teams shared?

- Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.
-  Rozovsky herself was reminded of this midway through her work with the Project Aristotle team.
