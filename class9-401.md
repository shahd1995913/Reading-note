#  Enriching Your Python Classes With Dunder (Magic, Special) Methods
## What Are Dunder Methods?
### - special methods are a set of predefined methods
### -  use to enrich your classes. 
### - easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores.

##  “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are called “magic methods.”
 ## Dunder methods let  emulate the behavior of built-in types.
 ##  For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string').

#  What is probability?
## At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?
- ” An event is some outcome of interest.
-  To calculate the chance of an event happening,  need to consider all the other events that can occur.
-  The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss.
## From statistics to probability
-  data will be generated by flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many times we get heads. 
- We  call a set of 10 coin tosses a trial.
