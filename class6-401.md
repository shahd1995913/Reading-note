# What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
## --> The process of identifying the risks in application that built and prioritizing them to test.
## Risk Identification
- ## There are different sets of risks, Those are as follows:

### 1. Business Risks:
-  This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company , not from your project.

### 2. Testing Risks:
-  You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

### 3. Premature Release Risk:
-  a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory.

### 4. Software Risks:
-  risks associated with the software development process.
## Risk Assessment

### -  why people focus on coverage numbers??
###  because they want to know if they are testing enough.
### -  Certainly low coverage numbers ----> say below half, are a sign of trouble. 
### - But high numbers  ---->  don't necessarily mean much, and lead to ignorance-promoting dashboards.
